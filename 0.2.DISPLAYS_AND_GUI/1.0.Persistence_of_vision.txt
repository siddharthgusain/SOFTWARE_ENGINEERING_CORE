-> Your eye and brain retain a visual impression for about 1/30 of a second.
(The exact time depends on the brightness of the image.) 
This ability to retain an image is known as persistence of vision.

->  Persistence of vision is the optical phenomenon where the illusion of motion 
is created because the brain interprets multiple still images as one. 
The human eye and brain can only process about 12 separate images per second, 
retaining an image for 1/16 of a second.

-> Displays having more than "16 fps" can create an illution of motion,thereby 60fps 
displays give smooth videos and animations as compared to lower FPS displays.

-> Due to fast computation by GPU Chips , more than 16 fps can be easily achieved hence giving rise to 
digital video.

-> The frame rate is the number of images that a computer, video game console, 
video player, or other device sends to the display every second. 
Meanwhile, the refresh rate is how fast the display can actually show those frames.
