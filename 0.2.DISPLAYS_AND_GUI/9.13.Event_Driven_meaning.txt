-> All the programs that we write while solving algorithm questions are sequential programs that runs and 
terminates after completion.

-> Any GUI software is a software that is infinitely running (until user explicitly closes it) and user interacts with the
GUI frames with "EVENTS" that could be from any I/O device like keyboard , mouse , network adaptor etc.

-> To run some code on this EVENTS , we as developer writes "CALLBACK FUNCTIONS".

-> In programming and software design, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating 
"ASYNCHRONOUSLY" from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or 
triggered by the system, by the user, or in other ways. Typically, "EVENTS ARE HANDLED SYNCHRONOUSLY" with the program 
flow; that is, the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an "EVENT LOOP.

-> A source of events includes the user, who may interact with the software through the computer's peripherals - 
for example, by typing on the keyboard. Another source is a hardware device such as a timer. 

-> Software can also trigger its own set of events into the event loop, e.g. to communicate the completion of a task. 
-> Software that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be ""EVENT DRIVEN", often with the goal of being 
"INTERACTIVE".
