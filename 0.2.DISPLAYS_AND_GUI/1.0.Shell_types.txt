-> Shell is another program that could be considered as part of operating system but can be easily replaced with other 
shell softwares.

Shells are mainly of two types :-
1. Command line Shell
2. Graphical Shell

-> Both are softwares that are part of operating system.

-> Command line interface / shell is easier to implement as it takes character input from keyboard like input device and 
runs corresponding command/file/program.

-> E.g :- powershell(Windows) , bash(Linux) , Zsh(MacOS)

> node index.js :- Here "node" is program that will be forked(fork()) by shell and "index.js" is the input to the node process.

-> Graphical user interface are also softwares which are not part of operating system but are delivered with operating system as a bundle
-> When Kernel is loaded into Memory(RAM) , it loades the GUI code of operating system.

-> We will discuss various parts of GUI layer of operating system.
