-> class declaration is similar to structure
-> by Default if no "access specifier"(private/protected/public) is specified,
then all members of class are "private", but in structure they are "public"
-> variables inside class are called "data members" 
-> functions inside class are called "member function"
-> SOME CONCEPTS OF OOPS :- 
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction


WHY BING DATA AND FUNCTIONS TOGETHER ?
-> In large code base ,global variables can cause a lot of bugs
-> For scalability designing things in object oriented can solve a lot of problems
-> All the real things around us can be simulated in computers in form of objects
-> Inheritance leads to reusability of code 
-> variables outside class can be accesses by any functions and produce bugs in 
production, in class we can define the accessibility of variables.
