-> NON PERSITENT CONNECTION (HTTP 1.0)
-> If a web page has 4 image references , 4 different TCP connection will be made to get those images

-> PERSISTENT CONNECTION (HTTP 1.1 ONWARDS)
-> With persistent connections, the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response. 
-> Subsequent requests and responses between the "SAME CLIENT and SERVER" can be sent over the same connection.

-> Typically, the HTTP server closes a connection when it isnâ€™t used for a certain time (a configurable timeout interval).
Also known as TCP timer management algorithm(JCOBSON ALGORITHM).

-> The default mode of HTTP uses persistent connections with pipelining.
