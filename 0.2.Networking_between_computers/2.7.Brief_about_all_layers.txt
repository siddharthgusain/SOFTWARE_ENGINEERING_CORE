We will follow bottom-up approach:-

1. Physical Layer:
-> Mostly deals with signals and encoding
-> Responsible of movement of individual bits in terms of signal.
-> Physical topology is defined here.
-> Various types of digital encoding like :- manchester , differential menchester
-> Part of Network interface card

2. Data link Layer
-> Framing is done here.
-> Part of Network interface card chip
-> Error control at the frame level
-> Physical addressing by adding headers(Mac address)
-> Hop to hop delivery

3. Network Layer
-> Software Layer
-> Part of operating system network stack
-> Responsible for source host to destination host delivery
-> IP address takes place here(Logical addressing)
-> Routing takes place here
-> Fragmentation takes place here

4. Transport Layer
-> Software Layer
-> Part of operating system network stack
-> Responsible for process to process delivery
-> Process port number is added here.
-> Segmentation and reassembly takes place here
-> Connection control , error control

5. Session Layer
-> Dialog control and synchronisation
-> Part of application software like chrome.

6. Presentation Layer
-> Translation, compression , encryption 
-> Part of application software like chrome.

7. application Layer
-> User interface and user directly intracts with this
-> Part of application software
