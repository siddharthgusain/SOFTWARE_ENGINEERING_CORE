-> Most imporatant part of transport layer is to uniquely identify a process within a machine
-> Port number helps in uniquely idendifying process
-> Port number is assigned by operating system to each process connecting to some network

1. Source and destination port:- 16 bits number
-> Total ports possible 0 to 65535 =  65536 ports possible
Ports are categorizeed by IANA:-
i. Well known  ports -> 0-1023
ii. Reserved ports -> 1024-49151
iii. For public use -> remaining

To uniquely identify a process two things are rquired IP + port also known as "socket" => 48 bit number

2. Sequence number:- To uniquely identify segments made by TCP protocol

3. Header length:- size of Header

4. Acknowlegment number :- Sequence number of bytes expected next by reciever

5. Flags bits :-
i. SYN , ACK, FIN :- used for TCP connection and termination phase
ii. URG :- To send urgent data before already send data
iii. PSH:- Push the segment to application layer even if size is less than MSS(maximum segment size)
i.v RST:- Reset if something wrong with connection

6. Advertisement window:- For flow control in transport layer(only in TCP not in UDP)

7. Checksum field:- For error control

8. Options:-
i. Timestamp
ii. Window size extention
iii. Paramter negotiation
iv. Padding
