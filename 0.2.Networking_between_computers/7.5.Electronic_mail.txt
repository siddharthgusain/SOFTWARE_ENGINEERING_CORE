-> Electronic mail service uses two protocols:-
1. To push message :- SMTP
2. To pull message:- POP3, IMAP

-> Both are connection oriented as they use TCP in transport layer
-> Email is Like sending File but we can't use FTP , because for FTP both client and server should online at the same time.
-> Both are In-band
-> SMTP is stateless and POP3 is stateful
-> SMTP and POP3 are pure text base but MIME is used to extend its capabilities

-> SMTP works at port number 25
-> POP3 works at port number 110 
-> IMAP works at port number 143

SMTP:- simple mail transfer protocols
POP3:- Post office protocol
IMAP:- internet message access protocol
