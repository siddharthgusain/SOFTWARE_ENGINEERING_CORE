-> Flow control:- Set of procedures used to restrict the amount of data that sender can send before waiting
for acknowledgment

-> These Protocols are implemented as a part of driver and operating system network stack
Various types of channels are:-
1. Noiseless
-> Simplest Protocol
-> Stop and wait Protocol

2. Noisy channels
-> Stop and wait ARQ
-> GO back N ARQ
-> Selective Repeat ARQ


Error detection
1. Parity
2. Checksum
3. CRC(cyclic redundancy check)
