->  In particular, an application-layer protocol defines:
1. The types of messages exchanged, for example, request messages and response
messages.
2. The syntax of the various message types, such as the fields in the message and
how the fields are delineated.
3. The semantics of the fields, that is, the meaning of the information in the fields
4. Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to
messages.


NOTE:- Some application-layer protocols are specified in RFCs and are therefore in the "PUBLIC DOMAIN".

-> For example, the Webâ€™s application-layer protocol, HTTP (the HyperText Transfer Protocol [RFC 2616]), 
is available as an RFC. 

-> "If a BROWSER DEVELOPER follows the  rules  of  the  HTTP RFC,  the  browser  will  be  able  to  retrieve Web  
pages  from  any WEB SERVER that has also followed the rules of the HTTP RFC".

-> Many other application-layer protocols are proprietary and intentionally not available in the public
domain. E.g :- redis URI , mongodb URI , Database URI and many other protocols

-> For example, "SKYPE" uses "proprietary application-layer protocols"

-> New public domain and proprietary Internet applications are being developed everyday
