-> contructor are normal functions with some property
-> As a developer we need not to call them explicitly like other functions are called 
but when the source code is compiled they are called just after object creation by the compiler
-> So, the compiler does the heavy lifiting of adding extra "calling instruction" when object is created

There are 3 types of contrcutors:- 
1. Default contructor 
2. Parameterized contructor 
3. Copy constructor
