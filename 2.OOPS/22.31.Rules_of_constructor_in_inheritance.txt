-> We have talked about constructor which are simple functions which are called while object 
is created (this is done by compiler though);
-> We have talked about constructor overloading
-> If Parent class only have default constructor , its not mandatory for child class to 
have constructor
-> But in case parent class have parameterized constructor , then derived class should have constrcutor 
which pass the argument to parent class constrcutor;(Like in react we call super() from our class)
-> If we create a child class object -> first Parent class constrcutor is called then child class
