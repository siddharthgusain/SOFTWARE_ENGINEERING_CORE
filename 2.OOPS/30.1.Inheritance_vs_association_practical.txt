-> Inheritance, as its name implies, involves inheriting attributes and behaviors from other classes. In this case, there is
a true parent/child relationship.The child (or subclass) inherits directly from the parent
(or superclass).

-> Composition involves using other classes to build more complex classesâ€”a sort of as-
sembly.

->There is no parent/child relationship in this case. Basically, complex objects are
composed of other objects. Composition represents a "HAS-A" relationship. 

-> For example, a "Car has an engine". Both the engine and the car are separate, potentially standalone ob-
jects.

-> However, "the car is a complex object that contains (has an) engine object".
