-> Manipulating display pixels is considered as graphics
-> It could an image video , any animation etc.
-> GPU is a application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed to handle these pixel manipulation
really fast.
-> CPU was not designed to do so.
-> Rise of GUI programming ,gaming , and displays gives rise to GPU.
-> Just like to acess CPU we take help of an abstaction i.e OS and to access GPU and sending it 
instructions,we have an abstraction layer of graphics libraries like :-
1. OPENGL
2. VULKAN
3. DIRECT3D(DIRECTX)(WINDOWS)
4. METAL(IOS , MACOS)

-> ALL THESE ARE API WHICH CONTAINS BUNCH OF COMMONLY USED FUNCTION TO ACCESS GPU AND DRAW SOME SHAPES AND 
MANIPULATE PIXELS AS WELL.

-> Application like Browsers , Android OS use any of these library to render GUI elements or any graphics/pixels
to the screen behind the scenes.

-> Browser itself is a complex software written in C++ which does a lot of abstraction to web developers.
-> Understanding browser is must to understand where can we speed up the Web applications.
