-> Multithreading  can be done on a single-processor system, 
and in fact it's much easier that way. It works the same way as running multiple processes 
-- the kernel, via a timer interrupt or other similar mechanism, suspends one, 
saving its machine state, and replacing that by the previously-saved state of another -- 
the only difference being that two threads of the same process share the same virtual memory space,
making the task-switch much more efficient.
