-> Network application architecture can be majorly categorized into:-
1. Client Server 
2. Peer to peer(P2P)

CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE :- 
-> In a client-server architecture, there is an "ALWAYS-ON" host, called the server,
which services requests from many other hosts, called clients
-> Note that with  the  client-server  architecture,  clients  do  not  directly  communicate  with  each
other. for example, in the Web application, two browsers do not directly communicate
-> Another characteristic of the client-server architecture is that the server has a
"FIXED", WELL KNOWN ADDRESS, called an "IP address" 

->  Because the server has a fixed, well-known address, and because the server is always on, a
client can always contact the server by sending a packet to the server’s IP address.
Some of the better-known applications with a client-server architecture include the
"Web, FTP, Telnet, and e-mail".

-> Often in a client-server application, a "single-server host is incapable of keeping up
with all the requests from clients that's why "SCALING OF BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE COMES INTO PICTURE(load balancing etc)"

-> In Client server , there is a "CENTRALIZATION OF DATA"". As many clients are connecting to same server.

PEER TO PEER:- 
-> In a P2P architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in
data centers. Instead the application exploits direct communication between pairs of
intermittently connected hosts, called peers.


-> The peers are not owned by the service provider, but are instead desktops and laptops 
controlled by users, with most of the peers residing in homes, universities, and offices. 
Because the peers communicate without passing through a dedicated server, the architecture 
is called peer-to-peer. Many of today’s most popular and traffic-intensive applications are based on P2P
architectures.

-> EXAMPLE :- BITTORRENT , Blockchain (WEB 3.0)

-> THere's no single server in peer to peer, decentralization concept comes from here

-> SECURITY IS MAJOR CHALLENGE IN PEER TO PEER DATA TRANSFER
