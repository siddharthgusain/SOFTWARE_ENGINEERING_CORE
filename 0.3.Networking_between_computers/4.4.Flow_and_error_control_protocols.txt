-> These Protocols are implemented as a part of driver and operating system network stack
Various types of channels are:-
1. Noiseless
-> Simplest Protocol
-> stop and wait Protocol

2. Noisy channels
-> Stop and wait ARQ
-> GO back N ARQ
-> Selective Repeat ARQ


Error detection
1. parity
2. Checksum
3. CRC(cyclic redundancy check)
