-> In Internet Protocol version 4, the address 0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to 
designate an invalid, unknown, or non applicable target

Uses Include:

1. The address a host claims as its own when it has not yet been assigned an address. 
Such as when sending the initial DHCPDISCOVER packet when using DHCP.

2. The address a host assigns to itself when an address request via DHCP has failed,
provided the hostâ€™s IP stack supports this. This usage has been replaced with the 
APIPA mechanism in modern operating systems.

-> Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature of Windows-based operating systems (included in 
Windows 98, ME, 2000, and XP) that enables a computer to automatically assign itself an IP 
address when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server available to perform 
that function.

3. A way to specify any IPv4-host at all. It is used in this way when specifying a default route.

4. A way to explicitly specify that the target is unavailable. 

5.A way to specify any IPv4 address at all. It is used in this way when configuring servers 
(i.e. when binding listening sockets).This is known to TCP programmers as INADDR_ANY. 
[bind(2) binds to addresses, not interfaces.]
