What is Fragmentation?
-> Dividing data into fragments in network layer before passing the data to Data link layer 
is called Fragmentation.

Why Fragmentation?
-> Each network or link imposes some maximum size on its packets. These limits have various causes:-
1. Hardware (e.g., the size of an Ethernet frame).
2. Operating system (e.g., all buffers are 512 bytes)
3. Protocols (e.g., the number of bits in the packet length field)
4. Compliance with some international standard
5. Desire to reduce error-induced retransmissions to some level.
6. Desire to prevent one packet from occupying the channel too long.

Note:- 
-> Transport layer will make "segment" keeping in mind the size of frame in DLL and network layer.
-> So , actually there is no fragmentation in "sender's side"
-> Fragmentation is done at routers, as router could be connected to various channels having different "MTU"

Lets discuss MTU and MSS:- 
-> MTU stands for maximum transmission unit at data link layer
-> MSS stands for maximum segment size at transport layer.

Some points about fragmentation :-
1. Fragmentation is done at routers not at the Source
2. Fragments are reassembled at "destination" not at the routers.
3. Each fragment can be uniquely identified with fields present in IP "header".
