RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol

-> Used to get IP address if MAC address is known
-> Generally when a new Machine is connected to router it gets it IP address with RARP.

There are alternatives to RARP --> BOOTP and DHCP(used currently) 
-> Both these Protocol are application layer Protocol
-> DHCP allows giving dynamic IPs from pool of IPs available
