IP addressing can be of two types :-
1. Classfull
2. ClassLess

CLASSFULL ADDRESSING
-> 2^32 IPV4 addresses are classified into classes 

Class A:- starts with "0" as first bit
Class B:- starts with "10" as first two bits
Class C:- starts with "110" as first three bits
Class D:- starts with "1110" as first four bits
Class E:- start with "1111" as first four bits

CLASSLESS INTERDOMAIN ROUTING(CIDR)
-> A chunk of addresses known as blocks are used 
-> a.b.c.d/n --> n is number of bits for network ID

Subnetting :- Dividing a large network into smaller networks
Supernettting:- aggregating multiple small networks into one supernet
