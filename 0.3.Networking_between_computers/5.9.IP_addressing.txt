IP addressing can be of two types :-
1. Class-full
2. Class-less

CLASS-FULL ADDRESSING
-> 2^32 IPV4 addresses are classified into classes 

Class A:- starts with "0" as first bit
Class B:- starts with "10" as first two bits
Class C:- starts with "110" as first three bits
Class D:- starts with "1110" as first four bits
Class E:- start with "1111" as first four bits

CLASSLESS INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING(CIDR)
-> A chunk of addresses known as blocks are used 
-> a.b.c.d/n --> n is number of bits for Network ID

Sub-netting :- Dividing a large network into smaller networks
Super-netting:- Aggregating multiple small networks into one super-net
