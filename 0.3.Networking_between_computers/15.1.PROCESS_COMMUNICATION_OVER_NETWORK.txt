-> Before building network application, we also need a basic understanding of
how the programs, running in multiple end systems, communicate with each other.

-> In the jargon of operating systems, it is not actually programs but "processes" that
communicate. 

-> A process can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system. When processes are running 
on the same end system, they can communicate with each other with inter-process communication, using rules that are
governed by the end systemâ€™s operating system(Shared Memory and Message Passing).

-> "But networking  we are not particularly interested in how processes in the same host communicate, but instead in
how processes running on different hosts (with potentially different operating systems) communicate".

-> A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software
interface called a SOCKET(IP + PORT =  48 bit number).
