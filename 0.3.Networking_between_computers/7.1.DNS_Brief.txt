-> DNS stands for "domain name system"
-> DNS is application layer protocol which uses UDP headers in transport layer as there is only
request and reply involved
-> DNS works at port "53" i.e destination port number in UDP header should be 53.
-> It is in-band
-> It uses UDP so it is connection-less
-> It is stateless as well.
