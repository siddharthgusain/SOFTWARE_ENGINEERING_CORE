What is the IP Address 127.0.0.1?

127.0.0.1 is the loopback Internet protocol (IP) address also referred to as the localhost. 
The address is used to establish an IP connection to the same machine or computer being used by the end-user.

The same convention is defined for computers that support IPv6 addressing using the connotation of ::1. 
Establishing a connection using the address 127.0.0.1 is the most common practice; 
however, using any IP address in the range of 127…* will function in the same or a similar manner. 
The loopback construct gives a computer or device capable of networking the capability to validate
 or establish the IP stack on the machine.

127.0.0.1 – What Are its Uses and Why is it Important?

Special Addresses

The class A network number 127 is assigned the loopback function, 
that is, a datagram sent by a higher level protocol to a network 127 address 
should loop back inside the host. No datagram sent to a network 127 address 
should ever appear on any network anywhere.

If it is Whole Class A, What is the Point of Other Arbitrary Values for the Last Three Octets?

The purpose of the loopback range is testing of the TCP/IP protocol implementation on a host.
Since the lower layers are short-circuited, sending to a loopback address
allows the higher layers (IP and above) to be effectively tested without
the chance of problems at the lower layers manifesting themselves. 
127.0.0.1 is the address most commonly used for testing purposes.
