URI:- Uniform Resource Identifier
Structure:- protocol
-> A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or 
physical resource used by web technologies.

URI is of two types :-
1. URL :- Some URIs provide a means of locating and retrieving information resources on a network 
(either on the Internet or on another private network, such as a computer filesystem or an Intranet); 
-> These are Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
-> A URL provides the location of the resource

2. URN:-  Other URIs provide only a unique name, without a means of locating or retrieving the resource or 
information about it, these are Uniform Resource Names (URNs)

Important Point to note:-
1. The web technologies that use URIs are "NOT LIMITED TO WEB BROWSERS" like database URI etc
2. URIs are used to identify anything described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

URI SYNTAX :-
* URI = scheme ":" ["//" authority] path ["?" query] ["#" fragment]
* The authority component consists of sub-components:
-> authority = [user-info "@"] host [":" port]
-> Examples of popular schemes include http, https, ftp, mailto, file, data , irc , ws, wss. 
-> URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), 
although "Non-registered schemes are used in practice" Like Any "connection string" that we use in databases is a non
registered Scheme.
