-> Shells are actually special applications that use the kernel API in just the same way as it is used by other application programs.
A shell manages the user–system interaction by prompting users for input, interpreting their input, and then handling an output 
from the underlying operating system .

-> Since the operating system shell is actually an application, 
it may easily be replaced with another similar application, for most operating systems.

-> Some popular shells :-
Window :- powershell
Linux :- Bash(bourne again shell)

-> Most operating system shells fall into one of two categories – 
command-line and graphical.
-> Command line shells provide a command-line interface (CLI) to the operating system,
while graphical shells provide a graphical user interface (GUI).
-> Other possibilities, although not so common, include voice user interface and 
various implementations of a text-based user interface (TUI) that are not CLI.
The relative merits of CLI- and GUI-based shells are often debated.

(CLI-COMMAND LINE INTERFACE)
-> A command-line interface (CLI) is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters 
typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system,interactively.

-> "The command interpreter parses the sequence of keystrokes and responds with an error message if 
it cannot recognize the sequence of characters, or it may carry out some other program action such
as loading an application program,listing files, logging in a user and many others"

-> Application programs may also implement a command-line interface
 E.g:- "Git CLI, Npm CLI , Heroku CLI"

(Shell Scripting)
-> A feature of many command-line shells is the ability to save sequences of
commands for re-use. A data file can contain sequences of commands which the 
CLI can be made to follow as if typed in by a user. 
-> Special features in the CLI may apply when it is carrying out these stored 
instructions. Such batch files (script files) can be used repeatedly to automate
routine operations such as initializing a set of programs when a system is 
restarted.

(GRAPHICAL SHELLS)
-> A graphical user interface (GUI) provides means for manipulating programs graphically,
by allowing for operations such as opening, closing, moving and resizing windows,
as well as switching focus between windows. Graphical shells may be included with
desktop environments or come separately, even as a set of loosely coupled utilities.

-> Most graphical user interfaces develop the metaphor of an "electronic desktop",
where data files are represented as if they were paper documents on a desk,
and application programs similarly have graphical representations instead of being
invoked by command names.
