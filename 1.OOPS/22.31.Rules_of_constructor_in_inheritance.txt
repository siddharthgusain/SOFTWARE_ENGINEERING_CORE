-> We have talked about constructor which are simple functions which are called while object 
is created (this is done by compiler though);
-> We have talked about constructor overloading
-> If Parent class only have default constructor , its not mandatory for child class to 
have constructor
-> But in case parent class have parameterized constructor , then derived class should have constructor 
which pass the argument to parent class constructor;(Like in react we call "super(props)" from our class)

-> If we create a child class object -> first Parent class constructor is called then child class
