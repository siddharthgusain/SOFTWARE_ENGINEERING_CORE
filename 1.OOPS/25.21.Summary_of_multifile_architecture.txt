-> All the directives like #if,#pragma #include , all these are used by preprocessor , compiler,
and linker to build final object containing machine instruction set that can be run by target CPU.

-> All the new rules , keyword that are introduced in language are made to make High level 
programming easier for developer , this make the design of compiler and linker more sophisticated.

->As a developer it becomes easier to debug and create bug free software in production.E.g classes
and objects .OOPS was just an concept which is implemented through programming constructs likes classes
these constructors are defined inside compiler in terms of grammar and rules.

-> So , if we somehow make mistakes in development , compiler , or linker or preprocessor will give
error while each individual phases.

-> Writing code in high level is much easier but the underlying architecture that converts this 
source file to machine instruction is quite complex and is built in last 30-40 years.

-> So all the tools are developed to make final software shipping faster , so there are engineers making
tools like compiler , IDE,Drivers, Operating system,Graphics library to let developers ship 
final software faster and bug free.
