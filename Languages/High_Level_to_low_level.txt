1. CPP file is a simple text file containing bunch of characters in some syntax that could be
understood by compiler.
2. Source code -> preprocessor -> PURE HLL file
3. PURE HLL file -> Compiler -> Assembly file
4. Assembly file -> Assembler -> Object file/Machine code
5. Different Object file -> Linker -> Fully linked /partially linked Object/executable file.

-> So the compiled executable runs directly on machine as it contains instruction set of That CPU Architecture
-> So mostly each architecture like x86 , ARM has its own compiler 
-> We can't take executable compiled in windows to run in Linux or vice versa

*** Java is different 
-> They have one more software layer in btw  (Hardware,OS and Object file) that is JVM which is software which converts 
intermediate Java object file to final Instruction set of particular architecture.

*** Language JS and Python are interpreted ****
-> They also run on top of software known as Runtime Environment or engine
-> Also they are not converted to intermediate code before running on Runtime environment 
-> Thats where they differ from Java
-> Direct Text file containing JS or Python code is given as input to Runtime Software like JS engine.

*** RUST is similar to C/C++****
-> Differences is syntax and its compiler adds code to free memory during compile time. 
-> Actually C++ also has Smart Pointers now , so its compiler also adds code to free memory i.e delete system call
-> RUST get compiled directly to computer instruction SET


NOTE:- The program we will be writing will be synchronous single threaded programs(they could be multi file)
