-> Inbuilt data types like int and float , are all keywords which tells compiler to allocate 
specific predefined size for a variable , depending on operating system and computer organization and Compiler

-> User defined data types are identifiers which binds together more than one type of variable together
as well as functions to manipulate these variables.

-> Structure and classes are just templates/ identifiers which defines the size to the compiler , object is the 
actual memory.

-> In case of inbuilt data type , we call the memory variable , while in case of user defined data type 
we call it an "object".
