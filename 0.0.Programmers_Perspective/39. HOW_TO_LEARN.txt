1. Dont try to build already existing solution from scratch 
2. Try to use already existing solution like software tools and frameworks(Git,devtools,react,webpack etc).
3. Learn in terms of abstraction as most of the solution/softwares had been built before , 
   work on top of it to remain relevant to current time.
E.g :- To solve the problem of memory management , process isolation , OS has been built already, 
try to learn the API exposed by OS to work on top of it
4. Research the already existing solution and try to improve it instead of writing it from scratch.
5. Compare previous solution with new one to find the improvement.
6. Use google properly to find already existing solution (Reusability) but understand it properly.
7. Learn the basics really well -> keep on exploring new features of "existing solution" along with using it.


Things to keep in mind while learning software development:-
1. Learn the language basic in which u will write the software + best practices(code reusability and readability)
2. Understand Software design /architecture and project structure(Folder structure,file structure, design patterns , coupling/cohersion )
3. Understand the build process of that software development (E.g Web apps build process, Android/IOS application build process  etc)
4. Understand Already available tools for building that kind of application(e.g Android Studio, X-code , visual studio code)
5. Read Other people code(open source) to understand project architecture and programming best practices.
