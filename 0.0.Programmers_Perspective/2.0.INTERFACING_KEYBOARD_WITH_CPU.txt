KEYBOARD
-> Keyboard is simplest input device that we use everyday.
-> Keyboard has keys which can have threee states:-
1. pressed
2. hold
3. Released

-> Keyboard sends 8 bits(1 byte) corresponding to key pressed which can be read by CPU.
-> Releasing a Key also sends two things:-
1. Bits to say key is being Released
2. Bits for the actual key 

-> Keyboard also has Clock to synchronise the data sending.
-> It gets interfaced with CPU with some connector e.g PS/2 , SPI , USB
-> Keyboard has its own chip to known as controller.
If a keyboard is a separate peripheral system unit (such as in most modern desktop computers), the keyboard
controller is not directly attached to the keys but receives scancodes from a microcontroller embedded in 
the keyboard via some kind of serial interface. In this case, the controller usually also controls the 
keyboard's LEDs by sending data back to the keyboard through the wire.

-> Now this keyboard controller gives interrupt signal to the interrupt key in CPU , and corresponding ISR
is RUN that is generally part of operating system.

-> A "keyboard buffer" is a section of computer memory used to hold keystrokes before they are processed.
-> Keyboard buffers have long been used in command-line processing. As a user enters a command, they see it
echoed on their terminal and can edit it before it is processed by the computer.

-> ALL other computers are interfaced with some interface or PORT standardised by IEEE.
-> ALL the ISR(interrupt service routines) are also written according to these specs . Generally ,there are
drivers shipped with each hardware component which is actually a small program which is written using
IEEE specs and is called by operating system to receive data or send data to correposnding component
E.g Keyboard driver, Mouse driver, GPU driver , Joystick driver etc

-> NOTE:- All these interfacing is already done inside motherboard by companies like Apple, Dell, HP etc.
