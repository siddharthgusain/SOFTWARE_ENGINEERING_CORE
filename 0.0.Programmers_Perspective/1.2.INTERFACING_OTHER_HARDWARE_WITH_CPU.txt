KEYBOARD
-> Keyboard is simplest input device that we use everyday.
-> Keyboard has keys which can have threee states:-
1. pressed
2. hold
3. Released

-> Keyboard sends 8 bits(1 byte) corresponding to key pressed which can be read by CPU.
-> Releasing a Key also sends two things:-
1. Bits to say key is being Released
2. Bits for the actual key 

-> Keyboard also has Clock to synchronise the data sending.
-> It gets interfaced with CPU with some connector e.g PS/2 , SPI , USB

Now this keyboard gives interrupt signal to the interrupt key in CPU , and corresponding ISR
is RUN that is generally part of operating system.

MOUSE
-> Mouse also sends the data in same way 

RAM 
-> RAM is interfaced with CPU via data and address lines
-> RAM is made up of FLip flops which store 1 bit 

-> ALL other computers are interfaced with some interface or PORT standardised by IEEE.
-> ALL the ISR(interrupt service routines) are also written according to these specs . Generaly ,there are
drivers shipped with each hardware component which is actually a small program which is written using
IEEE specs and is called by operating system to receive data or send data to correposnding component
E.g Keyboard driver, Mouse driver, GPU driver , Joystick driver etc
