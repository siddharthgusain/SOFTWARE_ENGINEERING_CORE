-> Each OS has some built in programs which can be recognized by shell through Environment 
variables.

-> E.g ls , pwd - these are also known as shell commands , these are inbuilt OS files in which
instructions are written like listing files in the directory . These files are always present at a particular directory that could
be different for different OS. But Every shell program(CLI) checks first the local directory and then the environment variable
registry to find external programs like "git","node","docker","npm".

-> External Programs like g++ , java compiler , git cli , node cli should be included
in environment variable so that shell can run them using the location given in PATH variable

-> After shell runs the command the control goes to the specific program like node , git , g++ etc and 
there is inter-process communication going on between the shell and other program .
For e.g -> shell forks a process and provides node path in it , now two process are communicating with each 
other via some IPC mechanism that OS provides.
