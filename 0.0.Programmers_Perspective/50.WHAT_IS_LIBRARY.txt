1. Libraries are nothing , just a common function tied together.
2. These functions are commonly used functions like input function that interacts with keyboard,
output function that prints to display using OS system call.
3. E.g C library , C++ library
4. Including a library file is actually equal to copying and pasting the functions inside your
program.
5. Most of the standard libraries are in precompiled format and are linked with our program by "linker".
E.g #include<iostream.h> this file only contains type defition and function signature , actual code of 
functions are precompiled in "libc" and is linked to our program in linking phase.
NOTE:-  GCC COMPILER DOES EVERYTHING FOR US ,i.e COMPILATION -> ASSEMBLY -> LINKING.
6.SO IN ANY LIBRARY WE GENERALLY FIND FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL IN EVERY PROGRAM .E.G "printf",
"scanf", file manipulation function , Some math related functions(pow,sqrt) etc.
