-> Context Switch means switching between processes,which is done by operating system 
routine.
-> Steps of context switching :-
The code of context switching inside kernel do this:-
1. Save the current state of processor (register set, program counter , other registers)
into RAM inside data structure known as PCB(process control block).
2. Load the state of another process from RAM inside PCB, specially program counter.
3. Execution of other process start.

-> Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching
-> Switching speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers that must
be copied, and the existence of special instructions (such as a single instruction
to load or store all registers). A typical speed is a few milliseconds
