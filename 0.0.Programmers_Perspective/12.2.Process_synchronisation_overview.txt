What and why synchronization?
* Independent processes :- completed isolated process
* Cooperative processes :- processes sharing resources(either hardware and software)

Independent processes don't need synchronization , but cooperative processes do .

E.g , Browser application is multi-process application which shares resources and also shares data btw each other 
like browser process shares events and data with renderer process(Blink) in chrome.

IPC also known as inter-process communication means communication between processes 

Note:- 1. Processes can be within same computer or different computers(communicating through network)
2. We will keep our discussion to processes within same computer for now.
