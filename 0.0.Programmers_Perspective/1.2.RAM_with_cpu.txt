-> Every program in modern computer is stored in RAM where it is executed by cpu line by line.
-> RAM interface contains address pins , data pins and control pins(READ or WRITE)
-> RAM AND CPU interface is simple and is synchronized with clock 
-> CPU puts Address on address bus which is connected to RAM and sends control signal to read or write from
that address 
-> Now this data can be sent to any other device like monitor , GPU ,speaker , network card hardware etc.
-> At the starting , very small programs are directly put into RAM , and were written in binary directly.
-> Then people started writing programs in assembly and the wrote assembler to convert the source code assembly
to machine instruction set or executable.
