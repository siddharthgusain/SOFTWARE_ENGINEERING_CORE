If you’re coming from Windows, the Linux file system structure can seem particularly alien. 
The C:\ drive and drive letters are gone, replaced by a / and cryptic-sounding directories, 
most of which have three letter names.

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the structure of file systems on Linux 
and other UNIX-like operating systems. However, Linux file systems also
contain some directories that aren’t yet defined by the standard.

Window Partition structure is different , each drive is considered as a spearate harddisk,
usually C drive has the bootable code and other drives contain data .

In linux , everything is under root "/" directory.
/boot directory contains bootable code.
/home generally contains data files (non-bootable code).
other subdirectories difeerent useful files required by Linux OS.
