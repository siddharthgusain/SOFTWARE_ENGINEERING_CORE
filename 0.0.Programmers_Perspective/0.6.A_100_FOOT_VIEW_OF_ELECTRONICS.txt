1. It all started with invention of semiconductor (silicon,Germanium).
2. From semiconductor -> Diode(basic element)
3. Diode -> Transistors(PNP,NPN,MOSFET) 
3. Transistors -> Gates (Basic boolean circuit)(SSI)
4. Combinational circuits -> ALU, DECODERS/Encoders, MUX/DEMUX,BASIC MATHS CIRCUIT.
6. Sequential Circuit 
    -> Flip flops -> basic memory elements -> registers -> RAM / ROM/CACHE (LSI)
7. Other hardware circuits
 -> NIC, GPU , Keyboard , Mouse ,Displays, Wifi , Bluetooth ,microphone, speaker.
 -> Harddisk(mechanical device)

-> To put all these independent components into one place , motherboards/PCB was invented (VLSI)
-> All these components are interfaced to CPU by some standard connectors/ports standardized by IEEE.
-> Interface/Port define , the pin structure and data transfer structure.
