WHAT IS PolyGlot programming ?
-> Polyglot means more than one type of language.
-> In fairly large projects the source code contains multiple languages.
-> E.g Chrome is build with C++, javscript , html etc
-> Some parts are written in different languages in most of the big projects.

But how a project can contain source code with different langauges ?
-> On a high level thinking , each source code is finally compiled or interpreted into machine 
instruction set , it doesn't matter if it is written in different lanaguages. 
-> Building different parts of a large project with different languages is highly complex procedure
but in the end everything is compiled into machine code.


NOTE:- Keep in mind that compilers generate binary sequences which represent either native machine language instructions
and data, or an intermediate representation (e.g., bytecode, CIL, p-Code, etc.). The linker takes care of gluing 
the binary pieces together into a cohesive executable (or set of files required for execution). The linker doesnâ€™t 
really care what languages were used to implement each piece.
