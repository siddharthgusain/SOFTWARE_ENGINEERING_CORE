-> Right now we are working at a very high level of abstraction.

-> Whether we talk about android development or web development , in the end 
System software like OS , compilers are responsible for accessing hardware

-> We as a developer write code at very high level , all the common functionality
and low level task is taken care by system softwares like Operating systems

-> The end product that is app or website is generating revenue thats why developers are in demand.
but , all heavy lifiting is done BY OS and other system software and device drivers.

-> Operating system is like a program which contains common functionality that is required 
by every program like file system access, memory management ,Interprocess communication , networking
so these functionality are bundled inside OS code to provide reusability and we as a programmer 
dont need to write code for these things we can simply use system calls provided by Os
which helps in accessing hardware securely.

-> Operating system exposes an Interface in form of functions also known as
"system calls" which can be used inside high level program to access different hardware
like HDD, RAM , MONITOR , GPU , CPU etc.

-> But keep in mind in the end everything , website , app are all processes
or sequence of bits/intructions that CPU will understand

-> Network related work is also taken care by OS ,we mostly implement Application layer

-> Os is also responsible for Communication btw two or more processes via system calls

-> OS Creates PCB(process control blocks) which contains information like PID,Port number
, file access etc. to keep track of all process present in RAM
