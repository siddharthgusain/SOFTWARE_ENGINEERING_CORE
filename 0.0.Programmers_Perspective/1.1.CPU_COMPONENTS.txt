-> CPU has various components inside it .
1. ALU AND DATA PATH UNIT(DATA BUS AND ADDRESS BUS)

2. CACHE AND MMU

3. CONTROL UNIT(FOR READ and WRITE Signals)

4. REGISTERS
-> GPR(general purpose register)
The 8 GPRs are as follows:
Accumulator register (AX). Used in arithmetic operations
Counter register (CX). Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops.
Data register (DX). Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
Base register (BX). Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).
Stack Pointer register (SP). Pointer to the top of the stack.
Stack Base Pointer register (BP). Used to point to the base of the stack.
Source Index register (SI). Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.
Destination Index register (DI). Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.

-> IR (Instruction register)

-> PC(program counters)

-> SEGMENT RESGISTERS
The 6 Segment Registers are:
Stack Segment (SS). Pointer to the stack ('S' stands for 'Stack').
Code Segment (CS). Pointer to the code ('C' stands for 'Code').
Data Segment (DS). Pointer to the data ('D' comes after 'C').
Extra Segment (ES). Pointer to extra data ('E' stands for 'Extra').
F Segment (FS). Pointer to more extra data ('F' comes after 'E').
G Segment (GS). Pointer to still more extra data ('G' comes after 'F').

-> PSW(program status word)

5. CLOCK (for synchronisation)

TYPES OF CPU :-
1. SINGLE CORE -> Only one process/thread at a time (concurrency)
2. MULTICORE -> Multiple process/threads at the same time(Concurrency + parallelism)
