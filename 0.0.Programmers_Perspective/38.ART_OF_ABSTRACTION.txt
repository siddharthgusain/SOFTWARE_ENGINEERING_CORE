-> Any thing related to engineering is a build with the concept of abstraction.
-> E.g :- Mobiles to user is an abstraction as they do not need to know how under the hood
it is working , they just know how to give input like from keyboard and gets output on screen,
how screen is working it is "abstracted" from user.
-> As a developer it good to know how things work under the hood, but still learn things in abstraction as well
-> OS has created an abstraction for developers as well , we only need to know about system calls,
how OS does the work is abstracted inside the OS code.

-> Just Like we have two types of chip : 
1. General purpose
2. ASIC(application specific)

-> Softwares are also of two types :-
1. General Purpose :- Operating system
2. Application specific :- Any program/Application that runs on top of Operating system
