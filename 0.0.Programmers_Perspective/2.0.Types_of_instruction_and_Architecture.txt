-> Program =  data + instructions
Instructions can be broadly categorised into :-
1. Data transfer (from/to RAM or HDD)
2. Data manipulation
-> Logical operation
-> Arithematic operation
-> Shift operation
3. Logical 
-> if else 
-> looping

Instruction set architecture can be of two types:-
1. CISC(Complex instructions set computer) -> General purpose Computer chips
2. RISC(Reduced Instrcution set computer) -> Mobile , ASIC etc.
3. Minimal instruction set computers (MISC)
4. Very long instruction word (VLIW)
5. Explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC)
6. One instruction set computer (OISC)
7. Zero instruction set computer (ZISC)
