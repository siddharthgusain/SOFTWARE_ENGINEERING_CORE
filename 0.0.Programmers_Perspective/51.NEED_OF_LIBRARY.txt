-> Libraries provides reusablity of code and modularity 
-> They can be shared between developers to get the task done in lesser time.
-> Writing the same function everytime when we create a new program could be tiresome,
so better make a library and reuse it everytime.
-> E.g npm libraries,GUI libraries.
