-> Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library 
(or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the 
library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

-> It is one of the 3 mechanisms by which a computer program can use some other software; 
the other two are "static linking" and "dynamic linking". Unlike static linking and dynamic linking, 
dynamic loading allows a computer program to start up in the absence of these libraries, 
to discover available libraries, and to potentially gain additional functionality.
