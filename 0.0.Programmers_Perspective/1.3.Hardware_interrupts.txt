-> When we first power up a CPU , it goes to a particular address and start executing code 
line by line.
-> Lets talk about early days when operating system software were not there.
-> People used to load the whole program into RAM and run one program at a time.
-> CPU is loaded with starting address of program from where it executes everything line by line.

-> Then how the execution of program can be disturbed or changed?
Here comes into picture interrupt , we will talk about hardware interrupts first.
-> Each CPU has "1 or more pins" dedicated for interrupt signal which can be triggerred by any
external device like , Keyboard , mouse , network card etc.

-> Now the CPU hardware is designed in such a way that on receiving interrupt , it jumps to a predefinded
location in RAM which contains "interrupt vector table"(IVT) .

-> Now how CPU gets these address ?
Generally CPU has a register interrupt vector register which stores this address and this table can be modified
by priviledged softwares like operating system.
On system reset, the vector table is fixed at address 0x00000000. Privileged software can write to the VTOR (vector table offset register)
to relocate the vector table start address to a different memory location, in the range 0x00000080 to 0x3FFFFF80
-> Vector address table is dependend on CPU and operating system design.
-> Before OS , each program was in control of complete hardware and all the Interrupt service routine
were part of program itself.
-> Now All ISR are part of OS kernel and is written as low level routines in kernel itself and are used
by application processes to interact with hardware, so OS provides kind of API(system calls)

-> Each device can cause interrupt and for each interrupt has an ISR that is written in kernel whose address
is present in interrrupt vector table which is known by CPU.

-> Lets just assume ISR routines are present for each and every device present in our computer , although
ISR also calls driver programs in order to communicate with the hardware.Lets just keep it simple 
for the time being.

NOTE:- Interrupts are the basis of asynchronous and GUI programming.

-> By the way, the software that does all the interrupt handling, handles communication with the user 
and with hardware devices, and controls which thread is allowed to run is called the operating system.

-> The operating system is the basic, essential software without which a computer would not be able to
function. Other programs, such as word processors and Web browsers, are dependent upon the operating 
system. 

-> Common desktop operating systems include Linux, various versions of Windows, and MacOS. 
-> Operating systems for smartphones and tablets include Android and iOS.
