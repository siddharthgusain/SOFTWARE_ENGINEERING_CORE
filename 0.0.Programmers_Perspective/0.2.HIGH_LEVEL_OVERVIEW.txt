Modern Computers Have layered architecture to make things isolated and hidden from users, broadly
it can be divided into 4 layers:- 
1. Hardware Layer(Actual electronics devices)
-> CPU,GPU -> processors
-> ROM -> FOR small programs like bootloaders
-> Cache memory(inside cpu)
-> Memory(RAM) -> Volatile Memory
-> DISK(HDD,SSD) -> Non-volatile Memory
-> INPUT DEVICES:- Keyboard ,mouse any other device, microphone
-> OUTPUT devices:- Display , Speaker  
-> Network interface card(wifi ,ethernet)

2. System software layer(general purpose softwares) (Low level softwares)
-> Operating system 
-> Compilers
-> Drivers specific for each device to be interfaced
-> Graphics API pipeline

3. Software using OS services directly (Mid level software)
-> Browsers
-> DBMS 
-> Virtual machine softwares

4. Application software(Problem specific) ->(consumer facing products)-> For Developers 
-> WEB apps
-> IOS apps
-> desktop apps
-> Android apps

NOTE:- Each layer has its own complexity , and it solves the problem for developers, like graphics pipeline 
is very complex but it is hidden from developers they just need to declare the UI they want.
