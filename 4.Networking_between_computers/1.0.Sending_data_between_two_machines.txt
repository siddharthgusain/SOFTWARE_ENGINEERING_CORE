-> We have talked about computer system in details including various hardware and software abstraction that is present 
to build an user centric application/ program.

-> But what if we want to send data(any type) from one machine to another machine.

-> Sending data from one machine to another machine also contains a lot of abstraction.

-> Broadly speaking:-
1. Physical/hardware infrastructure.
2. Software infrastructure and protocols.

Physical Infra:-
1. Wires :- fibre optic cables , ethernet cable , copper cable etc.
2. ISP(localized internet providers)
3. Routers
4. Data centers(Servers storing data accessible to everyone)
5. Network Interface card(Chip designed for sending data packets)

Software Infra:-
1. Protocols implementation at various abstraction(like ar operating system level , at application level , at firmware level)
2. Various application programs 
3. Theoretical model of layers defining protocols.
