By memory we mean RAM (Random access memory).
-> In early days of computing when operating system were not there, each program can easily access memory by simple
assembly instruction like Mov R1, MEM[1000]. 
-> But Operating system abstracted the access of Main memory by writing  all the code to manage memory in its kernel 
and let application program access memory by system calls.

-> Memory management also gives protection from invalid memory access and isolation btw two or more programs.
(using virtual memory).

-> Memory management is done with help of hardware as well as kernel code.

-> Main memory and the registers built into the processor itself are the only
general-purpose storage that the CPU can access directly. There are machine
instructions that take memory addresses as arguments, but none that take disk
addresses. Therefore, any instructions in execution, and any data being used
by the instructions, must be in one of these direct-access storage devices. If the
data are not in memory, they must be moved there before the CPU can operate
on them
