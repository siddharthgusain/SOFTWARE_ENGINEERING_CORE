-> Schedulers are small routines written in Operating system kernel , which perform
some basic task required to do process scheduling at different stages.

There are 3 types of schedulers :-
1. Long Term Scheduler (LTS) / Job Scheduler
-> Responsible for picking and scheduling process from pool of process present
and loads that process into RAM
-> Controls the "degree of multiprogramming".
-> It should take the mix of "CPU Bound" and "I/O bound" processes.

2. Short Term Scheduler(MTS) / CPU Scheduler
-> Selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them
-> The primary distinction between these two schedulers lies in frequency of execution.
-> The short-term scheduler must select a new process for the CPU frequently. 
A process may execute for only a few milliseconds before waiting for an I/O request. Often, the short-term scheduler executes at least once every
100 milliseconds. 
-> Because of the short time between executions, the short-term scheduler must be fast. 
If it takes 10 milliseconds to decide to execute a process for 100 milliseconds, 
then 10/(100 + 10) = 9 percent of the CPU is being used (wasted) simply for scheduling the work.

3. Middle Term Scheduler
-> For swapping btw RAM and hard-disk.
