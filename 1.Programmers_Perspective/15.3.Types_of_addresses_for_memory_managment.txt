When it comes to memory management , it is combined effort of hardware + OS code.
There are two types of addresses :-
1. Logical address:- address present in CPU registers are all Logical addresses that is address relative to 
current running program considering program to be present as a whole in RAM.
2. Physical address :- the actual memory location inside RAM.

The conversion is done by hardware IC MMU(Memory Management Unit)  along with Kernel code which maintains
segment table or page table for each process.
