-> system calls are ways to access kernel code from user program 
-> System call is part of exception control flow called trap.
-> We have already seen the assembly of user program containing system call.

-> There are 100's of system calls available , here the list of linux system calls:-
http://linasm.sourceforge.net/docs/syscalls/index.php

NOTE:- there is difference btw system call and normal function call
-> SYSTEM call changes the mode bit in program status word register of CPU.
-> User program stack is not used for system call routine , it uses kernel stack.
-> System call is an kind of exception control flow while function call is an normal "call" instruction
which jumps to subroutine written by user inside "CODE SEGMENT" of process.
