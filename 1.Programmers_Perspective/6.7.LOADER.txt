:-> To run an executable object file p, we can type its name to the Unix shellâ€™s
command line:
:- unix> ./fileName
-> Since fileName does not correspond to a built-in shell command, the shell assumes that fileName is an executable object file, which it runs for us by invoking some memory-
resident operating system code known as the loader. 
-> Any Unix program can invoke the loader by calling the "execve" function. 
-> The loader copies the code and data in the executable object file from disk into memory, and then runs the
program by jumping to its first instruction, or entry point. This process of copying the program into memory and 
then running it is known as "loading".
