-> Inheritance is "IS-A" relationship .
-> Inheritance is used when we have a class and we want some of its property in other class as 
well , then we need inheritance.
E.g:- Class Student , Class Engineer , where Engineercinherits from Student

-> Assocation is different from inheritance , association is used when we have two diffrent classes
but we donmt want some of the perperties of one class inm another but still there is a relationship
that exists btw these classes i.e "HAS-A" relationship
E.g class BOOK , class Page , Page doesnt want properties of BOOK and vice versa but BOOK HAS-A Page


Association is of two types :-
1. Aggregation :- one way relationship
2. Composition :- two way relationship
