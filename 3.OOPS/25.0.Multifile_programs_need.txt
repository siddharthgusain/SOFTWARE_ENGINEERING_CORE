-> The programs that we were writing till now were only single file which gets compiled
and executed in CPU.(pretty starightforward).
->But as we go from 10 lines of code to million lines of code it is very importent to manage the 
source code by breaking in into chunks or into different files and directory.
-> Multifile programs are easy to manage and scale where each file may be library, headers or
some constant file etc.
-> With multifile programs , there is need of some software which can bundle them and compile
them and link them into one final object code which can be executed by CPU.
-> To Design multifile programs we divide the whole software into managable modules.
