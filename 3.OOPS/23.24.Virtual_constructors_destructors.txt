-> We have talked about virtual keyword and virtual member functions, constructors and destructors
are also member functions of a class , although we dont explicitly call them.

-> So can contrcutors and destructors be virtual , if yes then when to use them ?

<================ VIRTUAL DESTRUCTORS ==============>
-> yes virtual destructors are possible , but when to use them ?
In particular, here’s when you need to make your destructor virtual:

1. if someone will derive from your class,
2. if someone will say new Derived, where Derived is derived from your class,
3. if someone will say delete p, where the actual object’s type is Derived but the pointer 
p’s type is your class.


<================ VIRTUAL CONSTRUCTORS ===============>
-> NOT POSSIBLE!!!!
-> As we know compiler inititlizes the v_ptr inside constructor itself, so if the constructor itself 
is virtual it will lead to Undefined behaviour
